# 2.0.1  (2013-09-01)

## New Features

### Close Button
Optionally enable a close button

    toastr.options.closeButton = true;

Optionally override the close button's HTML. 

    toastr.options.closeHtml = '<button><i class="icon-off"></i></button>';

You can also override the CSS/LESS for `#toast-container .toast-close-button`

### Callbacks
	// Define a callback for when the toast is shown/hidden
	toastr.options.onShown = function() { console.log('hello'); }
	toastr.options.onHidden = function() { console.log('goodbye'); }

### Animation Options
Toastr will supply default animations, so you do not have to provide any of these settings. However you have the option to override the animations if you like.

####Easings
Optionally override the animation easing to show or hide the toasts. Default is swing. swing and linear are built into jQuery.

	toastr.options.showEasing = 'swing';
	toastr.options.hideEasing = 'linear';

Using the jQuery Easing plugin (http://www.gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/)

	toastr.options.showEasing = 'easeOutBounce';
	toastr.options.hideEasing = 'easeInBack';

####Animation Method
Use the jQuery show/hide method of your choice. These default to fadeIn/fadeOut. The methods fadeIn/fadeOut, slideDown/slideUp, and show/hide are built into jQuery.

	toastr.options.showMethod = 'slideDown'; 
	toastr.options.hideMethod = 'slideUp'; 
	

###Timeouts
Control how toastr interacts with users by setting timeouts appropriately.

	toastr.options.timeout = 30; // How long the toast will display without user interaction
	toastr.options.extendedTimeOut = 60; // How long the toast will display after a user hovers over it

## Breaking Changes

###Animation Changes
The following animations options have been deprecated and should be replaced:
 
 - Replace `options.fadeIn` with `options.showDuration`
 - Replace `options.onFadeIn` with `options.onShown`
 - Replace `options.fadeOut` with `options.hideDuration`
 - Replace `options.onFadeOut` with `options.onHidden`

# Version 1.3.1
